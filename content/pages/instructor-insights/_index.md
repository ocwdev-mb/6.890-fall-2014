## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course *6.890 Algorithmic Lower Bounds: Fun with Hardness Proofs* as it was taught by Professor Erik Demaine in Fall 2014.

This course addressed algorithmic reductions and techniques for proving problems are computationally hard for a variety of complexity classes. Students created interesting gadgets, learned many hardness proof styles, explored the connection between games and computation, surveyed several important problems and complexity classes, and crushed hopes and dreams (for fast optimal solutions).

Students met twice a week for lectures and had the opportunity to meet once a week for optional problem-solving sessions focused on jointly solving open problems.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

- Learn when to give up the search for efficient algorithms
- See connections between computational problems
- Solve puzzles to prove theorems
- Solve open problems

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

Many students who took this course in Fall 2014 met after the course was over to continue their work on open problems.

Other possibilities for further study included courses in complexity theory or advanced algorithms.

## Assessment

The students' grades were based on the following activities:

- 20% Problem sets
- 10% Scribed notes
- 50% Final project
- 20% Final presentation

## Student Information

### Enrollment

37 students

### Breakdown by Year

Both graduate and undergraduate students

### Breakdown by Major

Mostly computer science majors

### Typical Student Background

Although many students were computer science majors, few were theoretical computer scientists. Most had strong backgrounds in algorithms.

The course was designed for people working on challenging problems (by using heuristics or relatively slow algorithms, for example) and who needed to learn how to prove that their approaches were the best choices for solving the problems. 6.890 provided these students with a practical approach for proving hardness.
